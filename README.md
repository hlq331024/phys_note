This physics note records topics that I find interesting or subtle. Comments and discussions are welcome!

sXXeYY = Weinberg chapter XX section YY.



# Math reading

Recently I've decided to read some math texts seriously and carefully, with the aim being that for each topic that I have chosen for myself, pick one book and read it from the first to the last sentence. That is, try my best not to skip anything in order to get a coherent, integral view of the topic.

Up to now I have read the following:

+ 数学分析：数学分析新讲 by 张筑生
+ 线性代数：Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler
+ 点集拓扑：Topology Without Tears by Sidney Morris ( **Unfinished**: Skipped chapter 10 after remark 10.3.34 and chapter 12 ) ( Why study: Topological structure fundamentals. The study of general spaces. )
+ 抽象代数：Algebra by Michael Artin ( Reading ) ( Why study: Algebraic structure fundamentals. Almost all operations that we do in physics can be viewed as some algebraic manipulations. )
+ 复分析：Complex Analysis by Eberhard Freitag & Rolf Busam ( Reading )
